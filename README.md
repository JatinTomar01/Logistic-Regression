Logistic Regression:

This project demonstrates how Logistic Regression can be applied to predict outcomes based on given input features. Logistic Regression is widely used in machine learning for binary and multi-class classification problems

Project Overview

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression

Goal: Build and evaluate a classification model.

Applications: Logistic Regression can be used in:

Spam detection

Customer churn prediction

Medical diagnosis (e.g., disease prediction)

Sentiment analysis

Steps Implemented

Data Preprocessing

Loaded dataset and handled missing values.

Performed feature scaling and encoding if required.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions of features.

Checked correlation between input variables and target.

Model Training

Applied Logistic Regression from scikit-learn.

Trained on training dataset.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated performance using metrics like:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

ROC Curve & AUC Score

Prediction

Predicted outcomes for new/unseen data.

Technologies Used

Python

Google Colab

Libraries:

Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Model)
